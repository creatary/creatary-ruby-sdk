How to Use
----------
If you are using rails then:

1. Add the creatary-sdk gem to your Gemfile

```ruby
	gem 'creatary-sdk'
```

2. Create a creatary.yml file in config with following contents:

```yaml
	development: &defaults
		consumer_key:     # the consumer key generated in telcoassetmarketplace.com for you application
		consumer_secret:  # the consumer secret generated in telcoassetmarketplace.com for you application
		consumer_handler: # the of the class that implements the Creatary handler logic
	test:
		<<: *defaults
	production:
		<<: *defaults
```
		
3. Add following route to your routes.rb

```ruby
	match '/creatary/(:string)' => Creatary::API 	# you can replace 'creatary' with any other namespace
```
	
4. Implement the Creatary handler logic (e.g.: creatary_handler.rb in helpers)

```ruby
	class CreataryHandler
	  def authorized(user, session)
		# should return the URL to which Creatary should redirect
	  end

	  def denied(session)
		# should return the URL to which Creatary should redirect
	  end
	
	  def receive_sms(from_user, to_app, body)
	  end
	  
	end
```	

5. The routes exposed by the gem in your rails application are:

```ruby
	/creatary/authorize
	/creatary/receive_sms		# use this one (complement to form absolute path) as SMS URL when registering your application in telcoassetmarketplace.com
	/creatary/oauth_callback  # use this one (complement to form absolute path) as OAUTH callback URL when registering your application in telcoassetmarketplace.com
```
